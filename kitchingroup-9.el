;;                   Pd, and Pt monolayers supported on other transition
;;                   metals. Strain and the ligand effects are shown to change the
;;                   width of the surface d band, which subsequently moves up or
;;                   down in energy to maintain a constant band filling. Chemical
;;                   properties such as the dissociative adsorption energy of
;;                   hydrogen are controlled by changes induced in the average
;;                   energy of the d band by modification of the d-band width.},
