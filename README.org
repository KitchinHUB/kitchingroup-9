                  illustrate how the combination of strain and ligand effects
                  modify the electronic and surface chemical properties of Ni,
                  Pd, and Pt monolayers supported on other transition
                  metals. Strain and the ligand effects are shown to change the
                  width of the surface d band, which subsequently moves up or
                  down in energy to maintain a constant band filling. Chemical
                  properties such as the dissociative adsorption energy of
                  hydrogen are controlled by changes induced in the average
                  energy of the d band by modification of the d-band width.},
