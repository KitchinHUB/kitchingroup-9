  Abstract =	 {Based on an extensive set of density functional
                  theory calculations it is shown that for a class of
                  catalytic reactions there is a universal, reactant
                  independent relation between the reaction activation
                  energy and the stability of reaction
                  intermediates. This leads directly to a universal
                  relationship between adsorption energies and
                  catalytic activity, which is used to pinpoint what
                  it is that determines the best catalyst for a given
                  reaction. The universality principle rationalizes a
                  number of known facts about catalysts and points to
                  new ways of improving them. (C) 2002 Elsevier
